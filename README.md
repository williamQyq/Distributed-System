# Fault Tolerant Distributed System

This repository contains implementations of various networking and distributed systems concepts in Java. Below are descriptions and links to each folder containing the respective implementations:

1. [TCP/UDP Socket Server](./TCP_UDP): This folder contains Java implementations of a simple TCP and UDP socket server.

2. [RMI (Remote Method Invocation)](./RMI): This folder contains Java implementations of RMI, a mechanism that allows an object to invoke methods on an object running in another Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3. [Two-Phase Commit](./TwoPhaseCommit): This folder contains Java implementations of the Two-Phase Commit protocol, a distributed algorithm used to achieve atomicity in distributed transactions.

4. [Paxos Consensus](./Paxos): This folder contains Java implementations of the Paxos consensus algorithm, which is used to achieve consensus among a group of distributed processes.
